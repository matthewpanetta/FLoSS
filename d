[31m-Executive Summary[m
[31m-The Business Analysis Benchmark report presents the findings from surveys of over 100 companies[m
[31m-and definitive statistics on the importance and impact of business requirements on enterprise[m
[31m-success with technology projects. The survey focused on larger companies and looked at[m
[31m-development projects in excess of $250,000 where significant new functionality was delivered to[m
[31m-the organization. The average project size was $3 million.[m
[31m-The study has three major sections:[m
[31m-     1. Assessing the Impact of Poor Business Requirements on Companies: Quantifying the cost[m
[31m-        of poor requirements.[m

[31m-Findings Review[m
[31m-The report finds 2 basic scenarios for companies:[m
[31m-     a) Scenario 1 (68% of companies): project success is ‘Improbable’: Projects might[m
[31m-        succeed – but not by design. Based on the competencies present, these companies[m
[31m-        are statistically unlikely to have a successful project. 68% of companies fit this scenario.[m
[31m-     b) Scenario 2 (32% of companies): project success is ‘Probable’: Companies that can[m
[31m-        expect to have successful projects, by design, due to the investments that they have[m
[31m-        made in Business requirements process. 32% of companies fit this scenario.[m
[31m-Organizations recognize that requirements are important to project success, yet 68% did not[m
[31m-take effective action on strategic projects.[m
[31m-The following are a few key findings in the study:[m
[31m-1)      Companies with poor business analysis capability will have three times as many project[m
[31m-        failures as successes.[m
[31m-2)      68% of companies are more likely to have a marginal project or outright failure than a[m
[31m-        success due to the way they approach business analysis. In fact, 50% of this group’s[m
[31m-        projects were “runaways” which had any 2 of:[m

[31m-The Bottom Line[m
[31m-The challenges in making quantum improvement in business analysis capability should not be[m
[31m-underestimated.[m
[31m-Organizations understand conceptually that requirements are important, but do not internalize[m
[31m-this understanding and change their behavior as a result. The most successful of companies do[m
[31m-not view requirements as a document which either existed or didn’t at the beginning of a[m
[31m-project, they view it as a process of requirements discovery. Only companies that focus on both[m
[31m-the process and the deliverables are consistently successful at changing project success rates.[m
[31m-For companies that have made the leap to the use of elite facilitation skills and solid process in[m
[31m-requirements discovery there are significant benefits. Not only were these projects rarely[m
[31m-unsuccessful, these projects are delivered with far fewer budget overruns and in far less time.[m
[31m-Years of sub-optimal performance – experiencing significantly higher cost to produce[m
[31m-applications, longer wait times for implementation, and poorer achievement of strategic project[m
[31m-objectives – is debilitating to organizations. Quite simply, capital investment in technology at[m

[31m-The nine key findings from the above are:[m
[31m-   1. Many entrenched beliefs about requirements are wrong, and doom 68% of companies[m
[31m-       to project failure before the project ever really gets rolling.[m
[31m-   2. If your people and processes in business requirements are only AVERAGE, this lack of[m
[31m-       excellence will consume approximately 41.5% of the IT development budget for people[m
[31m-       (internal and external) and software on strategic projects.[m
[31m-   3. While people intuitively recognize the need for good requirements, they have not[m
[31m-       internalized the impact of poor requirements in a way that makes them change[m
[31m-       behavior[m
[31m-   4. The pay-off for those companies that have made improvements to the people and[m
[31m-       processes involved in requirements analysis is quite large, with over 70% of these[m
[31m-       companies reporting successful projects.[m
[31m-   5. Fully one-third of companies surveyed had three times more project failures than project[m
[31m-       successes. Given that their counterparts with excellent requirements processes had over[m
[31m-       70% of projects being considered successful, this pervasive failure can only be[m
[31m-       attributable to requirements quality.[m
[31m-   6. 68% of companies are Scenario 1 – They are unlikely to have successful projects.[m
[31m-       Moreover, 79% of Scenario 1 projects were over time and over budget. A whopping 50%[m
[31m-       of these projects were runaways (significantly over budget/time or under functionality).[m
[31m-   7. Two different IAG studies have now produced identical findings: there is a 60% time and[m

[31m-the Average Practitioners versus the Elite Practitioners of Requirements Discovery[m
[31m-Companies have been grappling with getting requirements right for a long time. More mature[m
[31m-companies often have large business analyst teams tasked to working projects. The ratio at a[m
[31m-few companies IAG works with is 1 analyst for every 2 developers. The challenge is that many of[m
[31m-these people will simply not be effective in certain roles. Data from this project underscores the[m
[31m-real issue: the “average” business analyst team will fail to get successful results in over 60% of[m
[31m-projects where a significant change to the existing approach to doing business is needed.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-IAG investigated the connection between the competencies of the business analysis team and[m
[31m-certain business outcomes expected by the business such as cutting costs, launching new[m
[31m-products, regulatory compliance, reengineering the business, etc. The results demonstrate a[m
[31m-remarkable difference between the performance of ‘average’ analysts and elite practitioners[m
[31m-where process change is an expectation of the project. The elite analyst MUST be following a[m
[31m-different process than the average analysts to create their success. There is no other[m
[31m-explanation for elite being successful in achieving objectives on 80% of projects, while in 60% of[m
[31m-cases the average analyst fails to achieve the same objective.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-IAG speculates that the underlying variable driving the discrepancy is the degree to which[m
[31m-analysts can rely on their personal industry or company understanding versus relying on the[m
[31m-requirements discovery skills of a professional analyst. To elaborate – take the insurance industry[m
[31m-example:[m
[31m-       An insurance company adding a new product (a coverage) is a fairly well[m
[31m-       established process. There is a well established business pattern and information[m
[31m-       set needed (rating rules, exclusions, terms, etc); the analyst can simply ‘fill in the[m
[31m-       blanks”. Most new products do not have significant process or processing[m
[31m-       changes so the average analyst with a high degree of industry or company[m
[31m-       understanding would perform the task very well.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-       There is limited process change in the above example – therefore the average[m
[31m-       analyst should perform quite well. If the new product had significant process[m
[31m-       change, then the analyst would not perform well.[m

[31m-There are three key messages in this data for both business and IT executive:[m
[31m-   1. Simply because a solution is small, or impacts few stakeholders, does not mean that this[m
[31m-       project is pre-disposed to success. The data shows quite the opposite.[m
[31m-   2. Companies need to do a better job of scoping smaller projects which have process[m
[31m-       change to better set time expectations and control costs. The project governance[m
[31m-       frameworks at many companies may not be placing enough scrutiny on these smaller[m
[31m-       project types to make them more efficient.[m
[31m-   3. For larger projects, there is a vast difference in performance success rates between the[m
[31m-       average analyst, and highly skilled analysts. Companies need to reconsider the wisdom[m

[31m-Having the requisite competencies is critical to controlled IT performance. It also means that if[m

[31m-Experience shows that the difficulty with scoping is that if anyone is asked, “Have you scoped[m
[31m-this project”, the answer is always “Yes”. Many organizations do not scope a project in a way[m
[31m-that links the span of activities under the project to the affected business processes within the[m
[31m-company. Often, the scoping statements are limited to project management or business[m
[31m-objectives statements, rather than statements that clearly delineate which process will be[m
[31m-effected and which ones will not.[m

[31m-Effective scoping when combined with strong business requirements discovery skills yielded a[m
[31m-successful project in 80% of circumstances. The findings suggest that competency in business[m
[31m-requirements discovery (also known as ‘elicitation’) drives scope control and vice versa. The two[m
[31m-variables are interdependent, however:[m
[31m-    1. Having bad scope control does not necessarily mean the[m
[31m-        project had very poor elicitation skills. In only 29% of the[m

[31m-The first tactic - if rigidly enforced – would cut the failure rate of projects by 80%. To implement[m

[31m-Finally, requirements discovery and elicitation is a process – not a deliverable. The findings are[m
[31m-very clear in this regard – companies that focus on both the process and the deliverables of[m
[31m-requirements are far more successful than those that only focus on the documentation quality.[m
[31m-Documentation quality can only assure that investment in a project is not wasted by an outright[m

[31m-About the Survey[m
[31m-[m
[31m-This survey is designed to scrutinize the impact of business analysts on North American business,[m
[31m-and the technology projects of these companies. The study started with a random sampling of[m
[31m-approximately 400 projects and winnowed this down to the 110 projects which fit precise criteria.[m
[31m-These criteria are:[m
[31m-     1. The project budget must be in excess of $250,000 for development, software and[m
[31m-         external services. This means we eliminate simple or routine projects that lack a[m
[31m-         moderate amount of complexity.[m
[31m-     2. The project must involve software development or application implementation. This[m
[31m-         means that we eliminate infrastructure or technology-only roll-out projects.[m
[31m-     3. The project must deliver business capability or software functionality that is significantly[m
[31m-         different than those which existed prior to the project. By this we eliminate most[m
[31m-         maintenance, bug-fix, or technology replatforming projects which do not really change[m
[31m-         the business.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Using these criteria, IAG removed bulk of maintenance or technology-only projects, and[m
[31m-focused on a subset of larger projects that are truly strategic to a company. In numbers, this[m
[31m-subset may account for less than 10% of total projects completed by the IT organization in a[m
[31m-year, but is also likely to account for as much as 50% of project spending. In fact, over 75% of[m
[31m-projects reviewed in our research were considered either “critically important” or “very[m
[31m-important” to the enterprise. This special class of project is typically:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-               Fundamental to the performance of the business.[m
[31m-               Larger, and typically cross-functional in nature with a high potential for project[m
[31m-               interdependencies.[m
[31m-               Represents the bulk of larger-scale project work which is initiated at companies[m
[31m-               today.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-This is a difficult class of projects for companies. Our research finds found only 20% delivered on[m
[31m-time, a mere 28% are delivered on budget, and less than 45% that delivered the full functionality[m
[31m-expected at the outset of the project. As a class, this grouping represents a significant amount[m
[31m-of expenditure – and an area of generally poor performance for large companies.[m
